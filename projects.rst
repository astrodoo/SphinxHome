Interaction of the jets with strong stellar wind
================================================

A subset of microquasars exhibits high peculiar velocity with respect to the local standard of rest 
due to the kicks they receive when being born in supernovae. The interaction between the radio plasma 
released by microquasar jets from such high-velocity binaries with the interstellar medium must lead 
to the production of trails and bow shocks similar to what is observed in narrow-angle tailed radio 
galaxies and pulsar wind nebulae. We present a set of numerical simulations of this interaction that 
illuminate the long-term dynamical evolution and the observational properties of these microquasar 
bow-shock nebulae and trails. We find that this interaction always produces a structure that consists 
of a bow shock, a trailing neck, and an expanding bubble. Using our simulations to model emission, we 
predict that the shock surrounding the bubble and the neck should be visible in Hα emission, the interior 
of the bubble should be visible in synchrotron radio emission, and only the bow shock is likely to be 
detectable in X-ray emission. We construct an analytic model for the evolution of the neck and bubble 
shape and compare this model with observations of the X-ray binary SAX J1712.6-3739.

Bow-shock Pulsar Wind Nebulae Passing Through Density Discontinuity
===================================================================

Bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae are a subset of pulsar wind nebulae that form when the pulsar
has high velocity due to the natal kick during the supernova explosion. The interaction be-
tween the relativistic wind from the fast-moving pulsar and the interstellar medium produces
a bow-shock and a trail, which are detectable in H α emission. Among such bow-shock pulsar
wind nebulae, the Guitar Nebula stands out for its peculiar morphology, which consists of a
prominent bow-shock head and a series of bubbles further behind. We present a scenario in
which multiple bubbles can be produced when the pulsar encounters a series of density dis-
continuities in the ISM. We tested the scenario using 2-D and 3-D hydrodynamic simulations.
The shape of the guitar nebula can be reproduced if the pulsar traversed a region of declining
low density. We also show that if a pulsar encounters an inclined density discontinuity, it pro-
duces an asymmetric bow-shock head, consistent with observations of the bow-shock of the
millisecond pulsar J2124-3358.

Mach Cone and Jet Trails in LMXB
================================
